Your voter registration form should arrive in the mail in the next 24 hours!  We sent it to:
<br><br>

<div>
  {{ registration.first_name }} {{ registration.last_name }}<br>
  {{ registration.request_mailing_address1 }} {{ registration.request_mailing_address2|default:"" }}<br>
  {{ registration.request_mailing_city }}, {{ registration.request_mailing_state.code }} {{ registration.request_mailing_zipcode }}<br>
</div>

<br>

<ol style="margin-left:0;padding-left:0">
  <li><strong>Sign and date</strong> the pre-filled registration form. Your signature may be checked against
    your state ID, so be sure to sign carefully.
  <li>If there are any errors on the pre-filled form, you can use the included blank form</li>
  <li>If there is someone else in your household who also needs to register, encourage them to use the included blank form and return it at the same time.</li>
  <li>Mail your completed form using the provided envelope and stamp to your local election clerk using the included tear-off address slip.</li>
</ol>

<hr><br>

Your voter registration form must be <strong>{{ state_info.registration_deadline_mail|markdownify }}</strong>.<br><br>

<hr><br>

You are not registered to vote until your state processes this form.  You should receive written confirmation within 1-2 weeks.
If not, you might want to <a href="https://www.voteamerica.com/local-election-offices/{{registration.state.code}}/">call your local election office</a>{% if state_info.external_tool_verify_status %} or use the <a href="{{ state_info.external_tool_verify_status }}">State of {{ registration.state }} website</a>{% endif %} to confirm that you are now registered to vote.<br><br>
