Your voter registration forms should have arrived a few days ago,

<br><br>

We realize that moving can be hectic.  Updating your voter registration
is just one of the many tasks that can easily get lost in the
shuffle.  We aim to make registering to vote as easy as possible.  The
sooner you mail in your registration, the less likely you'll forget!

We're here to make the process as easy as possible--we've even
included a stamped return envelope!

{% if state_info.external_tool_ovr %}

Although {{ state_full }}, like most states, allows <a href="{{
state_info.external_tool_ovr }}">online voter registration</a>, most
interstate movers do not yet have an in-state driver's license, which
means mailing in a form is the most reliable way to update your voter
registration.

{% endif %}

<br><br>

If you need more forms, or are already registered and would like to
request your absentee ballot to vote by mail,
visit <strong><a href="https://voteamerica.com/?refcode=integration_blank_forms_mailed">VoteAmerica.com</a></strong></a>.

  {% if state_info.early_voting_starts != 'N/A' %}
  <li>Early voting starts: <strong>{{ state_info.early_voting_starts }}</strong></li>
  <li>Early voting ends: <strong>{{ state_info.early_voting_ends }}</strong></li>
  {% endif %}
</ul>

<br><br>


{% if state_info.sdr_early_voting == 'True' or state_info.sdr_election_day == 'True' %}

{{ state_full }} allows for <strong>Same Day Registration</strong>
{% if state_info.sdr_early_voting == 'True' %}
during the <strong>early voting</strong> period
{% endif %}{% if state_info.sdr_early_voting == 'True' and state_info.sdr_election_day == 'True' %}
and
{% endif %}{% if state_info.sdr_election_day == 'True' %}on <strong>election day</strong>{% endif %}.
