            <summary>About This Tool</summary>
            <p>
                This tool managed e-signed absentee ballot applications. E-signed
                applications are signed online by the voter using their manual
                signature and our e-sign technology, and then submitted directly
                to the Local Election Official using email or fax.
            </p>
            <h4>Viewing applications</h4>
            <p>
                This dashboard lists every state where e-sign is enabled. You
                can click on the name of the state to see a list of all the
                regions in that state, along with how applications are being
                submitted in that region, and how many applications we've sent
                to that region's LEO recently. "Print at Home" indicates that
                e-sign is not available in that region, either because we've
                turned it off for that region, or because we do not have email
                or fax contact info for that region.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you need to see a specific e-signed application, you can do
                so by navigating to that state, and clicking "Applications"
                for the region. This will show you a list of all e-signed
                applications we have submitted to that region. You can then view
                individual applications, which will show you the submitted PDF
                (with any SSNs or driver's license numbers blanked). This feature
                is only available for applications submitted in the past 60
                days; after that the application and signature are automatically
                purged from our systems. This is useful to triage feedback about
                illegible or invalid signatures coming from LEOs.
            </p>
            <h4>Managing overrides</h4>
            <p>
                You can also manage "overrides" for regions. This allows you
                to disable e-sign for that region, change the submission method
                (e.g. force applications to be submitted by fax even if we
                are using email for that state), or change the email address /
                fax number we use.
            </p>
            <p>
                To turn off e-sign for a specific region, create an override
                for that region and set the submission method to "Print at Home".
            </p>
            <p>
                To change the submission email or fax number, create an override
                for that region and set the new email or fax number. If you're
                creating this override because the USVF data is incorrect,
                you should email USVF and submit the correct to them, then remove
                our override once the USVF data is updated (usually in a day or
                two). If you're creating this override because the region has
                a specific email for submitted electronic applications that's
                separate from the normal contact email, then you don't need to
                contact USVF about that (they don't track electronic submission
                addresses that are different from the contact addresses).
