# Election Information API

The Election Information API powers the VoteAmerica website and suite of tools.

It is available for others to use at no cost. If you build applications that integrate with it, please let us know so we can send you important data updates and new features.

This data has been gathered and vetted by our research staff, but if you see an error please [report it](https://www.voteamerica.com/report-incorrect-info/).

The API base URL is `https://api.voteamerica.com/v1/`. For example, you can try running `curl https://api.voteamerica.com/v1/election/field/`.

## GET `/election/field/`

Returns an array of state information field objects. Each contains a slug, a longer description, and a field format type.

Slugs can be matched to the results in `/state/{state}`. Descriptions are used as headers on VoteAmerica.com

### Field Types

You can find a listing of all of the 90+ Election Information API fields [on our website](https://www.voteamerica.com/election-data-api-fields/).
